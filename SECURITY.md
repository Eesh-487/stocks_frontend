# Security Guidelines for Stocks Application

## Docker Security

### Docker Image Security

Our application uses a distroless Node.js image (`gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian11`) that provides several security benefits:

1. Minimal attack surface - only includes what's needed to run Node.js
2. No shell access - reduces vulnerability to shell-based attacks
3. Runs as non-root by default - limiting privileges

### Security Measures Implemented

- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build environment from runtime environment
- **Security scanning**: npm audit during build to catch known vulnerabilities
- **No shell access**: Using distroless images that don't include a shell
- **Resource limits**: Set in docker-compose.yml to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Health checks**: Implemented for better reliability and monitoring
- **No new privileges**: Security option to prevent privilege escalation
- **Limited scope**: Docker ignore file to prevent unnecessary files from being included

## Application Security 

- **Helmet**: HTTP headers security middleware
- **CORS**: Restricted to specific origins
- **Rate limiting**: To prevent brute force and DoS attacks
- **Input validation**: Using middleware for request validation
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented via Helmet
- **Comprehensive health check**: Monitoring system components

## Future Security Improvements

1. **Secret Management**: Move secrets to a dedicated secret manager
2. **Container Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning with Trivy or Snyk
3. **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS for all connections
4. **Audit Logging**: Implement more comprehensive audit logging
5. **Container Image Signing**: Implement image signing for supply chain security

## Security Update Process

1. Regular dependency updates with `npm audit fix`
2. Container image rebuilds when base images are updated
3. Periodic security scanning of deployed containers
